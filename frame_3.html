My name is Autumn Waters and I am a CIS major at the University of Houston. This is my 2nd year at UH and also in Houston because I am orignally from Dallas,TX</i>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><font size="4">Some of my hobbies would include; hanging out with friends, watching true crime shows/documentaries, and just recently going to the gym.</p>

<p> Over the years, I have had major accomplishments within my life and they all will hold value to my heart forever. One of them being receiving the Terry Foundation Scholarship at UH.
It is an academic full ride scholarship with a $5,000 stipend to study abroad with. </p>

<p>After college, I want to travel to Germany, Italy, Brazil and Greece before coming home and settling down with a job. 
The perfect career for me would be a software developer but with this degree being so broad I can be flexible with whatever I choose.</p></font>
